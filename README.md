#  GUI-Based MP3 Music Player on Raspberry Pi

 This project showcases the integration of embedded systems by developing a music player with a graphical interface on a Raspberry Pi 3, interfacing with an Arduino-controlled matrix keypad for physical interaction. The Raspberry Pi handles the GUI and audio playback, while the Arduino processes user inputs via I2C/UART communication. The system enables song selection, play/pause, stop, track navigation, and volume control, demonstrating real-time interaction between multiple embedded platforms.
 
## File Setup

1. **Ensure the MP3.DESKTOP file is on the desktop.**
2. **Move the entire MP3 folder to the following path:**  
   `/home/pi/Documents/TE2003`
   - **Note:** If this directory doesn't exist, create it. Otherwise, you will need to modify the `MP3.DESKTOP` file and the `mp3_dir` file accordingly.

## Usage

To launch the program, follow these steps:

1. Click on the `MP3.DESKTOP` file.
2. The program will automatically start playing the first song in the list.
3. Use the following controls:
   - **Play/Pause:** Resume or pause the music.
   - **Stop (Alto):** Stop the music.
   - **Next (Siguiente):** Play the next song in the list.
   - **Previous (Anterior):** Play the previous song in the list.
4. Alternatively, click on any song in the list to play it.
